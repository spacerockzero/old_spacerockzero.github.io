**tldr;**
It affects conversions. 
It makes it possible to get your product into low-bandwidth and mobile-only areas. 
Users get more work done before running out of patience or time. 
There's lots of evidence and studies for all of this.

### Makes it possible to get into low-bandwidth and mobile-only areas
- (Pacific Islands, Africa, South Asia, South America)

### Users get more work done before running of patience or time
- Nobody likes waiting, and patience and willpower are finite. If our experience is slow, 
users would rather be somewhere else, like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Baidu, etc.

### Here are some web performance experiments to prove it

#### Akamai and Gomez.com found:
- https://blog.kissmetrics.com/speed-is-a-killer/ 
- Nearly half of web users expect a site to load in 2 seconds or less. - Users tend to 
abandon a site that isn't loaded within 3 seconds. - 79% of web shoppers who have trouble 
with site performance say they won't return to buy again and around 44% would tell a friend 
if they had a poor experience

#### Google found:
- Half a second delay caused a 20% drop in traffic
- 77% of searches from mobile devices take place at home or work, only 17% on the move.

#### Amazon found:
- Every 100ms increase in load time decreased sales by 1%

#### HTTPArchive found:
- Between 2011 and 2015, pagesize increased by nearly 3x, topping 2,000 kB (709kB to 2,008 kB)

#### Radware found:
- 55 web performance stats you'll want to know

#### Web Performance Today found:
- The Great Web Slowdown Infographic

#### Ericsson Mobility Report found:
- While mobile 3G and 4G LTE subscriptions are increasing rapidly, 2G-level subscriptions are 
currently around 4.5 billion, and will still stay as high as 2 billion until around the year 2020. 
This means keeping site weight low will continue to stay important for several years to come(pg. 7)
- Mobile saturation for China, Africa, and India are still below 100%, so we can expect several 
more mobile-only users coming online in the next few years, Many of whom have only used internet 
on a mobile device.(pg. 5)
- "90% of the world's population over 6 years old will have a mobile phone by 2020" (pg. 6)
- Central Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific are still predominantly 2G-based mobile 
subscriptions, and will still be under 50% LTE by 2020 (pg. 9)
