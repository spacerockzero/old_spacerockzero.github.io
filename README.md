# Casper Jekyll High-Perf

> This is a high-performance port of Ghost's default theme [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper) for Jekyll. 

Feel free to fork, change, modify and re-use it. Goal was to get the page load under ~14Kb after gzip. Lemme know how I did.  
Works with gihub.io pages, just push it to master of your {githubname}.github.io repo  
If you crave more speed, uncomment the `/assets/js/bundle.min.js` script tag on default.html and it will 
prefetch pages when users hover over links, via [Prefetch, by Joe Podwys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prefetch) 

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/spacerockzero/casper-jekyll-high-perf.git
    cd casper-jekyll-high-perf
    gem install jekyll
    gem install pygments.rb
    npm install

## How to use it

Build page and start local web server

```
# in two different tabs, since they both run a watch process
jekyll serve
gulp dev
```

Build page into `_site` folder

```
jekyll build && gulp
```

## Thanks

Based on [Kasper theme](http://github.com/rosario/kasper), by Rosario. Most of the work has been already done by the Ghost team and Rosario. I've just made it more high-performance.
